# PSoC® 6 Middleware

Each library is delivered in its own repository, complete with documentation. Both Cypress and third-party middleware is available. The information below includes links to each repository, and various resources associated with each library. Go to each repository to see what releases are available for that library. 

In addition to the individual code example links in the table, Cypress provides a [comprehensive set of code examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software) covering most if not all functionality in the provided middleware.

| [psoc6pdl](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/psoc6pdl) | The PSoC 6 Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) integrates device header files, startup code, and peripheral drivers into a single package. The library abstracts the hardware functions into a set of APIs for the drivers.<br />[API Reference](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc6pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)<br />[Examples for ModusToolbox 1.1](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-for-the-ModusToolbox-PSoC-6-SDK) (which uses an earlier version of this library)<br />Examples that use this version of the library are in the works |
| [capsense](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/capsense) | CapSense® is a Cypress capacitive sensing solution. Capacitive sensing can be used in a variety of applications and products where c nventional mechanical buttons can be replaced with sleek human interfaces to transform the way users interact with electronic systems. These include home appliances, and automotive, IoT, and industrial applications. CapSense supports multiple interfaces (widgets) using both Self-Capacitance (CSD) and Mutual-Capacitance (CSX) sensing methods with robust performance.<br />[API Reference](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/capsense/capsense_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)<br />[Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=example+capsense) |
| [csdadc](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/csdadc)   | This library provides an API that enables the ADC functionality of the CapSense Sigma-Delta hardware block. It can be useful for devices that do not include another ADC option. The CSD HW block enables multiple sensing capabilities on PSoC devices including self-cap and mutual-cap capacitive touch sensing solutions, a 10-bit ADC, IDAC, and Comparator. <br />[API Reference](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/csdadc/csdadc_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)<br/> [Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=example+csdadc) |
| [csdidac](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/csdidac) | This library provides an API that enables the IDAC functionality of the CapSense Sigma-Delta hardware block. It can be useful for devices that do not include another DAC option. The CSD HW block enables multiple sensing capabilities on PSoC devices including self-cap and mutual-cap capacitive touch sensing solutions, a 10-bit ADC, IDAC, and Comparator. <br />[API Reference](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/csdidac/csdidac_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) <br /> [Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=example+csdidac) |
| [emeeprom](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/emeeprom) | The Emulated EEPROM middleware emulates an EEPROM device in the PSoC device flash memory. It supports wear leveling and restoring corrupted data from a redundant copy. The EEPROM middleware operates on the top of the flash driver included in the PSoC 6 Peripheral Driver Library (psoc6pdl).<br />[API Reference](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/emeeprom/em_eeprom_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)<br />[Example](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-for-the-ModusToolbox-PSoC-6-SDK/tree/mt1.1/CE195313_PSoC_Emulated_EEPROM) |
| [emwin](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/middleware-emwin) | emWin is an embedded graphic library and graphical user interface (GUI) framework designed to provide an efficient, processor- and display controller-independent GUI for any application that operates with a graphical display. It is compatible with single-task and multitask environments. Developed by SEGGER Microcontroller, emWin is extremely popular in the embedded industry. Cypress has licensed the emWin library from SEGGER and offers it for free to customers.<br />[Overview & Docs](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/middleware-emwin/emwin_overview/html/index.html)<br />[Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=example+emwin) |
| [aws iot client library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/aws-iot) | This client library provides the interface for Amazon Web Services for IoT devices. AWS code examples download this library automatically, so you don't need to. <br />[Greengrass Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-aws-greengrass)    <br />[Publish/Subscribe Examples](<https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-aws-iot-client>) |
| [http-server](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/http-server) | HTTP server daemon connects to a Wi-Fi network as a STA (client), then starts a secure (or non-secure) web server and waits for requests. HTTP server daemon uses the Cypress HTTP-server library that provides support for various RESTful HTTP methods such as GET and POST; and has support for various content types [e.g. HTML, Plain, JSON]. The HTTP library is capable of handling content payload that is greater than MTU size using content length HTTP header. Chunked encoding is supported for both GET and POST operations (for POST request, chunked encoding is supported only for data that is less than a single MTU; content length headers are recommended for larger data).<br />[Example](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-http-server) |
| Bluetooth SDK                                                | The Bluetooth SDK is installed as part of the [ModusToolbox](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) Software Environment, and is not available separately on GitHub at this time. The SDK features a dual-mode Bluetooth stack with stack- and profile-level APIs for embedded BT application development. It supports GAP, GATT, SMP, RFCOMM, SDP, AVDT/AVCT and BLE Mesh protocols, as well as over-the-air upgrade. <br />[Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-BT-SDK-for-ModusToolbox) |
