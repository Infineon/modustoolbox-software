# I lost the secret for my API key - can I retrieve it?

Unfortunately, you cannot. Cirrent keeps your API key but does not keep your API secret. You'll need to generate a new API key and secret in the [API Key Console](https://go.cirrent.com/management/api-key), and then change your cloud to use the new API key and secret.
