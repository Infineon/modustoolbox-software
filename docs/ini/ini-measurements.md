# INI Measurements

A measurement represents time-varying numerical data that may help determine system conditions when an event occurs. Measurements are reported in Cirrent Console for each individual device and are not shown at an aggregate level.

## Network Performance Monitoring

The INI agent collects the following measurements for network monitoring:

Download Speed and Upload Speed (in Kbps)

Packet Error Rate %

Signal Strength

ICMP Packet Loss measurements (default gateways are google.com and yahoo.com)

## Application Performance Monitoring

You can add your own [Custom Measuremen](ini-custom-data-api)t to report numerical data relevant to your application or system. For example, you could report memory usage or CPU temperature data.
