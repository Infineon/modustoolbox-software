# Using OPS API to register devices

The OPS API is used for bulk provisioning of devices during your manufacturing process. The API is described in detail  [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Cirrent/api-ops/1.0.0-oas3). You can use Authorize button on the top right corner of the SwaggerHub page and then click "Try it out" for each API call to check the payload and responses.

You can use any one of the two options below for BasicAuth with this API:

1. Use Username and Password associated with Cirrent account

2. Use OPS API Key and Secret generated from Cirrent console

To generate OPS API Key and Secret, please go to  [API Key Management page](https://go.cirrent.com/management/api-key). Select Key Type as "OPS", enter a name for the key and click "Add". The Cirrent Console will generate OPS API Key and Secret.

==**Note:**  Cirrent does not store the API secret so it cannot be recovered if lost.==
